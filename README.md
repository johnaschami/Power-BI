## Overview
This repository contains Power BI resources, including datasets and assets, to support data visualization and analysis. The goal of this project is to determine if a US National tutoring program is effective in improving math and reading scores. We aim to analyze the data to validate our hypothesis and derive meaningful insights.

## Objectives
We aim to answer the following questions:
- Which school districts are performing the best?
- What state has the best reading scores?
- Does tutoring have a positive impact on student performance?
- What is the best time for tutoring sessions?
- How do extracurricular activities affect student scores?

## Repository Structure
- **Assets**: Contains images and reference materials.
- **Datasets**: Includes raw data used for Power BI reports.
- **.pbix **: Power BI Desktop file (contains reports, semantic model, and visuals).
